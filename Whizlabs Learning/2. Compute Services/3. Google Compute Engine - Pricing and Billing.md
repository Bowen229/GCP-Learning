## ðŸ§± Key Pricing Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Machine Type** | Billed per second (with a 1-minute minimum). Cost varies by vCPUs and memory. |
| **Operating System** | Additional charges for licensed OS (e.g., Windows Server). Linux is usually free. |
| **Disks**        | Charged by storage size and type (Standard or SSD persistent disks). |
| **Networking**   | Only **egress (outbound)** data is billed. Ingress (incoming) is free. |
| **Tenancy**      | Sole-tenant nodes cost more due to exclusive hardware hosting. |

## ðŸ§¾ Pricing Models

| Model                    | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **On-Demand Pricing**    | Pay-as-you-go, billed per second. No long-term commitment. |
| **Preemptible VMs**      | Up to 80% cheaper. Short-lived VMs, can be shut down by Google with 30s notice. Great for batch/fault-tolerant jobs. |
| **Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)** | Up to 70% discount for 1â€“3 year resource commitments. Ideal for predictable workloads. |
| **Spot VMs**             | Successor to Preemptible VMs with better availability. Still non-guaranteed, best for flexible workloads. |

## ðŸ’¡ Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Rightsize Your VMs**  
   Choose the exact specs your workload needsâ€”avoid over-provisioning.

2. **Use Preemptible or Spot VMs**  
   Ideal for dev/test, batch jobs, or fault-tolerant apps.

3. **Commit to Usage (CUDs)**  
   Commit to long-term usage for lower rates.

4. **Take Advantage of Sustained Use Discounts**  
   Automatically applied when VMs run for a significant portion of the month.

5. **Turn Off Idle Resources**  
   Shut down VMs when not in use to avoid waste.

6. **Use Pricing Tools**  
   - **[Google Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator)**: Estimate your costs.
   - **Cloud Console Billing Reports**: Monitor and analyze costs at the project level.
