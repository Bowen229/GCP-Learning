# ‚öôÔ∏è Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ‚Äì Compute Engine Overview

## üìå What is Compute Engine?

- **Google Compute Engine (GCE)** is GCP‚Äôs **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering.
- Allows creation and management of **virtual machines (VMs)** in the cloud.
- Suitable for workloads ranging from **development** to **large-scale production**.
- Built on the same global infrastructure as Gmail, YouTube, and Search.
