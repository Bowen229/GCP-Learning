# ☁️ Google Cloud Serverless Services – Summary

## 🚀 What Is Serverless Computing?

Serverless is a **cloud execution model** where you:
- Focus solely on writing code
- Don’t manage servers or infrastructure
- Are charged **only** for compute resources used

Google Cloud handles:
- Server provisioning and scaling
- Operating system and patch management
- Security and performance
