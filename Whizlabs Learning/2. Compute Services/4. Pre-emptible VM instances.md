# ‚ö° Google Cloud Preemptible VM Instances

## üí° What Are Preemptible VMs?

Preemptible VMs are **heavily discounted virtual machines** offered by Google Cloud.  
They run on the same infrastructure as standard VMs **but can be terminated at any time** with just a **30-second notice** if Google needs the resources.

---

## üí∞ Why Use Preemptible VMs?

The main reason: **Cost Savings** ‚Äî up to **80% cheaper** than standard VMs.

### ‚úÖ Ideal Use Cases:

| Use Case                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Fault-Tolerant Workloads** | Apps that can handle interruptions and restart gracefully. |
| **Batch Processing Jobs**     | Tasks that can be broken into chunks and run independently. |
| **Non-Critical Environments** | Dev/test, experimentation, or jobs where downtime is acceptable. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Preemptible VMs

| Limitation                  | Details |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| **Availability**            | Not guaranteed; depends on excess Google Cloud capacity. |
| **Max Lifespan**            | Always terminated after **24 hours**. |
| **No Live Migration**       | Cannot be converted or moved to a regular VM. |
| **No Automatic Restart**    | Requires **manual or scripted restart logic**. |
| **No SLA (Service Level Agreement)** | Not suitable for critical workloads. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Design for Fault Tolerance**  
   Your apps should handle unexpected shutdowns gracefully.

2. **Save Work State Regularly**  
   Persist progress to avoid data loss on termination.

3. **Automate Restarts**  
   Use startup scripts or managed instance groups for recovery.

4. **Consider Spot VMs**  
   Spot VMs are the **newer alternative** with potentially better availability and similar pricing.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Preemptible VMs are a **cost-effective** solution for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.  
They are perfect for **batch processing, testing, and fault-tolerant applications** ‚Äî but **not suitable for all workloads**.

Understanding their strengths and limitations helps you make smarter architectural decisions ‚Äî and prepares you well for the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification.
